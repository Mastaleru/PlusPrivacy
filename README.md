# PlusPrivacy

PlusPrivacy is an innovative open source Internet privacy service. The service aims to empower consumers to control and limit data that they transfer to service providers while using online services.Development of PlusPrivacy is funded by the European Union as part the OPERANDO project (www.operando.eu).

# Features
The current version of PlusPrivacy includes the following services:
* Unified social networks privacy dashboard – allows you to manage privacy settings of all your social networks in a single dashboard. There is also a “single-click privacy” button that automatically sets the privacy settings of all your SN accounts to their most privacy-friendly values. Currently Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are supported, with more SNs to be supported in the future.
* Unified extensions and apps privacy dashboard – allows you to review the extent to which each of the installed Chrome extensions and/or Facebook-, Twitter- and LinkedIn-connected apps intrudes on your privacy, and perform single-click disable/uninstall actions without digging into the account settings of Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Chrome, respectively.
* Alternative email identities service – allows you to generate up to 20 alternative email identities and use them in conjunction with your existing email service. Emails sent to your alternative identities will be automatically remailed to your email address, and your reply will be remailed back to the original sender, without disclosing your real email address.
* Ad blocking and anti-tracking – largely based on AdBlock Plus code, but without the “Acceptable Ads”. All ads and trackers are blocked until explicitly whitelisted by the user.
